## **Project Name: Microservices-Based Order Processing System with Message Queue**

### **Project Overview**

Design and implement a simplified online shopping order processing system using a microservices architecture. The system decouples order, inventory, payment, and notification modules, enabling asynchronous communication between services via a message queue. This enhances system scalability and fault tolerance while providing hands-on experience with message queues in real-world business scenarios.

---

### **Main Features & Modules**

**Order Service**

- **Functions:**
  
  - Receive user order requests, validate order data, and store it initially.
    - Validation ensures completeness and correctness:
      1. Order amount cannot be negative.
      2. Product ID must be valid.
      3. Purchase quantity must be a positive integer.
    - Frontend data validation methods:
      1. Use token-based authentication.
      2. Implement signature mechanisms.
      3. Prevent CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).
  - Publish order creation events to the message queue.

- **Key Learning Points:**
  
  - How to encapsulate business events as messages and publish them to a queue.

**Inventory Service**

- **Functions:**
  
  - Listen for order creation messages and check the inventory.
  - Lock inventory if available, then send confirmation or failure messages.

- **Key Learning Points:**
  
  - How to subscribe to a message queue and process messages.
  - Ensure **idempotency** (avoid duplicate inventory deductions).

**Payment Service**

- **Functions:**
  
  - Process order payments after inventory confirmation.
  - After payment completion, notify other services via message queue.

- **Key Learning Points:**
  
  - Implement an **asynchronous payment process** and simulate a payment gateway with callback handling.

**Notification Service**

- **Functions:**
  
  - Receive payment results or order status updates and send email/SMS notifications to users.

- **Key Learning Points:**
  
  - Message consumption and **reliable message delivery**.
  - Handling delayed tasks (e.g., order timeout notifications).

### **Application of Message Queue Technology**

- **Choosing a Message Broker:**  
  You can use **RabbitMQ, Kafka, or Redis Streams** for message queue implementation.
  
  - **RabbitMQ**: Best for understanding traditional messaging patterns, message acknowledgments, and routing.
  - **Kafka**: Suitable for **high-throughput** use cases, involving distributed logs and consumer groups.
  - **Redis Streams**: Provides real-time event streaming while leveraging Redis as an in-memory data store.

- **Core Concepts:**
  
  - **Publish/Subscribe Model**: Each service subscribes to messages relevant to its functionality.
  - **Message Acknowledgment & Retry**: Ensure reliable message processing with retries and dead-letter queues.
  - **Idempotency Handling**: Prevent duplicate processing errors (e.g., avoiding double inventory deduction).

---

### **Project Development Steps**

1. **Requirement Design & Technology Selection**
   
   - Define service responsibilities and API design.
   
   - Select a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ) and set up the development environment, possibly using **Docker**.

2. **Microservices Development & REST API Implementation**
   
   - Develop APIs for order, inventory, payment, and notification services.
   - Create a simple frontend or use **Postman** to simulate user actions.

3. **Integrating Message Queue**
   
   - The order service publishes **order creation events**.
   - Other services (inventory, payment, notification) subscribe to relevant queues and process messages.

4. **Enhancing Fault Tolerance with Error Handling & Retry Mechanisms**
   
   - Implement message acknowledgment and **dead-letter queues** for handling failed messages.
   - Add automatic **retry mechanisms** for message processing failures.

5. **Testing & Debugging**
   
   - Conduct **unit testing** for individual services and **integration testing** for end-to-end functionality.
   - Simulate business exceptions (e.g., out-of-stock, payment failures) to validate system robustness.

6. **Documentation & Summary**
   
   - Write project documentation covering service interactions and message queue usage.
   - Reflect on system optimization opportunities.

### **Key Learning Outcomes**

- **Understanding Asynchronous Architectures**: Learn how to decouple systems for better scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Familiarity with Message Queues**: Master the concepts of **publishing, subscribing, acknowledgment, retries, and dead-letter handling**.
- **Practical Experience in Microservices Design**: Gain hands-on knowledge of service communication and coordination.
- **Real-World Implementation Skills**: Apply message queues in business scenarios to optimize system performance.

---

### **1. Choosing a Framework**

- **Express.js**

---

### **2. Message Queue Integration**

- Express.js doesn't have intrinsic mechanism support message queuing. Nevertheless, it is able to support message broker function via middleware such as: 
  
  + RabbitMQ/Redis

---

### **3. Key Considerations for Microservices Architecture**

- **Service Decoupling**:
  
  - Message queues **reduce direct dependencies** between services.
  - Implement independent microservices for **order, inventory, payment, and notification processing**.
